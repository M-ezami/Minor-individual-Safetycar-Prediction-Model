<u>What problem do we want to solve?</u>
- We want to guess when a safety car is gonna come out in f1
- we want to guess this by lap 
- we use a supervisd leaning approach in which we label each lap with if eaither a safety ahs occured or hasnt occured

## leakage
<u>how do we prevent leakage?</u>

lets say safety car occurs at lap 13 the model isnt allowed to see data 
so we cant show lap 13 but we can make 3 differetn lables label at lap 10 at lap 11 adn at alp 12



## what data do we have
